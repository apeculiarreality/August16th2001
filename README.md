# What I did
My buzzfeed quiz works and meets the lab criteria. If the finished button is pressed after all the radio buttons are checked, then the button will disappear and the output display will appear where the button used to be. If a new radio button is checked, then the output display will disappear and the finished button will reappear.

# What worked
html and css set up was very straight forward

# What was difficult
It took me a while to figure out how to get started with javascript. I also had some trouble figuring out how to access the id of the checked radio box.
